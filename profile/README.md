Welcome to the GitHub home of the **UC Berkeley Astronomy Department graduate student community** — affectionately known as **BAD Grads**.

This repository serves as a shared space for:

- 🧭 Institutional knowledge

- 🛠️ Shared tools & resources
- 🧑‍🚀 Grad-student–run projects
- 🗂️ Things we wish someone had told us earlier

Whether you’re brand new, deep into your PhD, or about to defend, the repos in this organization are here to make life a little easier.
